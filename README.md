Project Management Approach
Methodology: Agile Scrum

For this project, I adopted the Agile Scrum methodology to ensure a structured and iterative development process. The project was divided into two sprints, each with specific goals and deliverables. Although this was an individual project, I followed the practices typically used in a team setting.

Sprint 1: Backend Development
Objective: Set up the backend infrastructure and implement essential functionalities.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to create an account so that I can access personalised features.

Tasks:

Set up MongoDB and configure the database.
Create Express routes for user registration and login.
Implement JWT-based user authentication.
As an admin, I want to manage user data so that I can ensure data integrity and security.

Tasks:
Set up an admin panel with CRUD operations for user management.
Implement role-based access control.



Sprint 2: Frontend Development
Objective: Develop the user interface and integrate it with the backend.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to log in and see a personalized dashboard so that I can easily access my data.

Tasks:
Create React components for the dashboard, login, and registration pages.
Implement Redux for state management.
Connect frontend forms to backend API for user authentication.
As an admin, I want to view and manage user accounts so that I can maintain system integrity.

Tasks:
Develop the admin interface in React with Material-UI for enhanced UI/UX.
Integrate API calls to fetch and manipulate user data.







Testing and Quality Assurance
Development Environment Testing:

Unit tests were written using Jest for backend logic, focusing on API endpoints and authentication functions.
Frontend components were tested using React Testing Library to ensure UI elements rendered correctly.


Production Environment Testing:

The application was deployed to a cloud service, and end-to-end testing was conducted to simulate real-world usage.
User feedback was collected to identify any issues in the production environment, which were then logged and addressed.



Testing Frameworks Used:

Jest: For unit testing backend functionality.
React Testing Library: For testing React components.


User Interface and Experience
Design Principles:

Responsiveness: The UI was designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices of different screen sizes.

Intuitive Navigation: The interface is designed with a focus on ease of use, providing a straightforward and pleasant user experience.
